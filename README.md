If you enjoy building developer productivity tools, reach out.<br>🌱 I’m currently learning Go with a focus on systems architecture. I am climbing the ladder toward Rust and other complex stuff to become a true CLI-native developer.<br>💬 Ask me about Go-to-Market strategies and Presentation design. I might be new to systems engineering, but I can help you sell and present your projects.<br>
